            <h2 class="topic">Yes, this website!</h2>
            <p>I started planning this website around a month before I actually started working on it. First I intended to use Jekyll, which is a static site generator that integrates very well with GitHub Pages, which I am currently using to host this site. I could not find a template that I felt was perfect, so I just started writing and going along with the documentation.</p>

            <h2 class="topic">Roadblocks I encountered</h2>
            <p>One of the major problems I encountered while doing this was everything changing when editing <a href="/css/style.css">style.css</a>. I try to align something to the centre and something moves where it shouldn't.</p>

            <h2 class="topic">How well I think I performed</h2>
            <p>I think I did rather well, considering this is only the second time I've done any sort of programming, and I went in with no experience whatsoever, and learned during the process. The source code could do some housekeeping since it's so hard to read. This is still an ongoing project with progress being done constantly. I am currently thinking about buying a domain name for this site or lending a free .tk or .cf domain name.</p>
